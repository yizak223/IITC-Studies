# Exercise 02

- Open `exercise/add-strings.ts`. This is TypeScript code that is not typed.
- Type the minimum number of variables/parameters to find a small bug in the implementation
- Run the code and see that it transpiles with no error but does not output the correct value
- Fix the bug (hint: use `parseInt` to convert the digit from string to a number)
- Run the code to see that it now outputs the correct value
- Add types to _all_ the variables
- Run it again to ensure that it's OK
