# 04 Exercise

- The `cart-service.ts` is a backend that saves shopping carts and their items
- It has a bug
- If you run `npm run test` you will run the tests in `cart-service.test.ts` and see that they fail.
- Note that `npm run test` is in "watch" mode so you can leave it running
- To find the bug, just add types!
- Add the _minimum_ amount of types this time
- The bug should become apparent, so fix it!
- Now the tests should pass ðŸŽ‰
