# Exercise 01

- Create a folder for a new TypeScript project (anywhere you want outside this repository)
- Follow the instructions from the [presentation](../README.html) to create a new package that has
  TypeScript code
- Try the following:
  - Executing and running the TypeScript manually (using `npx tsc` and `node ...`)
  - Executing and running the TypeScript on change
    (using `npm run build` in one window and `node --watch ..` in another)
  - Create an error in the file, see the errors showing up, and fix it
